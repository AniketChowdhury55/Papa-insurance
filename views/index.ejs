            <p>There is a gap in India between people who need to take care of their health, and the professionals
                equipped to help them do so. People have a lack of trust around pricing and quality, and tend to delay
                getting care for seemingly small issues. Our goal since the beginning has been to make accessing health
                and care less complicated for our customers. Today, whether it is a vaccination, relief for a teething
                child, or your general checkups, HealhAssure is able to help you find a quality provider less than 5 km
                away from you. As we grow, we are bringing in more personalization and more services to help you
                holistically manage your day-to-day health needs, and put more control of taking care of your health in
                your hands. </p>

        <div class="ser-box">
            <div class="smol">
                <p>Jeehan work tirelessly to earn and keep customer trust. We work backwards from customer needs and go
                    above & beyond to enable great experience. We resolve customer pain points and stay with helping
                    them till the issue is resolved. If we are not confident of using our product ourself or for our
                    family, we don't ship it to the customer. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="smol">
                <p>Jeehan always insist on the highest standards and do not settle for 'good enough' many people may think
                    these standards are unreasonably high. We continuously look to innovate and drive our teams to
                    efficiently deliver high output of quality products, services, and processes on time and at scale.
                    We work closely with our stakeholders/partners to ensure that the end result is achieved and nothing
                    is dropped. We do not send defects down the line, and ensure that problems are fixed so they stay
                    fixed. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="smol">
                <p>Thinking small will keep us small. We constantly think for the long term & think of ways to take our
                    organization to the next orbit. We use technology, systems, & mechanisms to scale & build leverage.
                    We pursue big ideas and instill belief in our teams to achieve them</p>
            </div>
            <div class="smol">
                <p>Jeehan accomplish more even with time and resource constraints. These constraints force us to become more
                    resourceful, self-sufficient, and inventive, with a high focus on customer quality. We are not fixed
                    in our thinking and create new approaches to problem solving when the conventional approaches do not
                    work or are not available. We innovate & creatively problem solve rather than waiting for others to
                    solve our problems, or by putting/throwing more money or people to solve something. For us it is
                    about overcoming limitations in the most economical and simple way and not being cheap. Being
                    inventive and resourceful is critical, else our inefficiencies will increase the cost of healthcare.

            <div class="smol">
                <p>Jeehan stay in touch with what's happening in our team at all levels. We effectively delegate, provide
                    ownership, and independence while ensuring the right audit/review mechanisms to keep us connected
                    with metrics, anecdotes, and defects related to our process and products. No task is beneath us, we
                    are willing to roll up our sleeves and take the required actions to deliver results. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="smol">
                <p>Jeehan respectfully say what we believe when it is in the best interest of our customer/company. Our
                    communication is direct, we say what we mean, even when doing so is uncomfortable or exhausting. We
                    do not compromise for the sake of social cohesion. Once a decision is determined (even if we
                    originally disagreed), we commit wholly and put all our energies behind it</p>
            </div>
            <div class="smol">
                <p>Jeehan are proud to work with health care services , because everything we do profoundly impacts lives around the world.
                    We realise that our individual roles impact lives & health of our customers and this energizes each
                    one of us to contribute our best to build great products and services</p>
            </div>
            <div class="smol">
                <p>Jeehan genuinely listen to and build collaborative working relationships with others. We understand that
                    it is our personal responsibility to earn trust and not demand trust & respect. We earn trust of
                    others by resolving and solving problems together. We do not hide our missteps, instead we are
                    forthcoming about them with an attitude to do better. We come together to solve the problem and to
                    ensure that the errors do not translate to customer impact. We come forward with problems or
                    information, even when doing so is awkward or embarrassing. Individuals who are vocally self
                    critical earn the trust of others and are appreciated for putting their ego aside. </p>
